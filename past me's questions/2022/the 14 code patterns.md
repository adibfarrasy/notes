## Sliding Window

When to use:

- When it involves linear data structures such as linked list, array, or string
- When it involves finding the longest/shortest substring, subarray or a desired value

Common questions:

1. maximum sum subarray of size K (_Easy_)
2. longest substring with K distinct characters (_Medium_)
3. string anagrams (_Hard_)

## Two Pointers/ Iterators

When to use:

- When it involves sorted arrays or linked lists and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints
- When the set of elements in the linear data structure is a pair, or triplet, or a subarray

Common questions:

1. Squaring a sorted array (_Easy_)
2. Triplets that sum to zero (_Medium_)
3. Comparing strings that contain backspaces (_Hard_)

## Fast and Slow Pointers

When to use:

- When the problem deals with a loop in a linked list or array
- When it involves finding the position of a certain element or the overall length of the linked list

Common questions:

1. Linked list cycle (_Easy_)
2. Palindrome linked list (_Medium_)
3. Cycle in a circular array (_Hard_)

## Merge Intervals

When to use:

- When it involves producing a list with only mutually exclusive intervals
- When two intervals possibly overlaps

Common questions:

1. Intervals intersection (_Medium_)
2. Maximum CPU load (_Hard_)

## Cyclic Sort

When to use:

- When it involves a sorted array with numbers in a given range
- When it involves finding the missing/ duplicate/ smallest number in a sorted/rotated array

Common questions:

1. Finding the missing number (_Easy_)
2. Find the smallest missing positive number (_Medium_)

## In-place reversal of linked list

When to use:

- When it involves reversing a linked list without using extra memory

Common questions:

1. Reverse a sub-list (_Medium_)
2. Reverse every K-element sub-list (_Medium_)

## Tree Breadth-First Search

When to use:

- When it involves level-by-level tree traversal

Common questions:

1. Binary tree level order traversal (_Easy_)
2. Zigzag traversal (_Medium_)

## Tree Depth-First Search

When to use:

- When it involves traversing a tree with in-order, preorder or postorder DFS
- When the problem requires searching for something where the node is closer to a leaf

Common questions:

1. Sum of path numbers (_Medium_)
2. All paths for a sum (_Medium_)

## Two Heaps

When to use:

- When it involves priority queue or scheduling
- When it involves finding the smallest/largest/median elements of a set
- Can be useful when used in questions featuring a binary tree data

Common questions:

1. Find the median of a number stream (_Medium_)

## Subsets

When to use:

- When it involves finding the combinations or permutations of a given set

Common questions:

1. Subsets with duplicates (_Easy_)
2. String permutations by changing case (_Medium_)

## Modified Binary Search

When to use:

- When it involves finding a certain element in a sorted array, linked list, or matrix

Common questions:

1. Order-agnostic binary search (_Easy_)
2. Search in a sortd infinite array (_Medium_)

## Top K Elements

When to use:

- When it involves finding the top/smallest/frequent K elements of a given set
- When it involves sorting an array to find an exact element

Common questions:

1. Top K numbers (_Easy_)
2. Top K frequent numbers (_Medium_)

## K-Way Merge

When to use:

- When it involves sorted arrays, lists, or a matrix
- When it involves merging sorted lists

Common questions:

1. Merge K sorted lists (_Medium_)
2. K pairs with largest sums (_Hard_)

## Topological Sort

When to use:

- When it involves graphs that have no directed cycles
- When it involves updating all objects in a sorted order
- When there is a class of objects that follow a particular order

Common questions:

1. Task scheduling (_Medium_)
2. Minimum height of a tree (_Hard_)
