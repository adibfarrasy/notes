# What to Look for in a Junior Developer

1. Good command in English. It sets up for easy bridging to the rest of the programming world. Docs, forums (i.e. stackoverflow), and syntaxes of programming languages mostly are written in English.

2. Love to read. The programming world is text-heavy. We don't want to have to teach proofreading and searching for relevant information online. Passion for reading also reduces the mental workload of learning programming long-term.

3. Have worked on a project by themselves. It reflects that the person has a high-level understanding of a project & its structure, and has the will and basic skills to carry out the project to completion.
