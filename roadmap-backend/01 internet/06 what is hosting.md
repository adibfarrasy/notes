## What is web hosting

Hosting is the home of the website. If you have a website, you need somewhere to host it (in a physical server).

Hosting is the computer and network infrastructure that keep your website available on the Internet.

The hosting server is a usually secure and performant server located in a data center. When buying a hosting service, you are actually buying the physical disk space on the server as well as the bandwidth.
