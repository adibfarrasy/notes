## How does the internet work

There are 3 major parts of the Internet:
- The first and last mile (receivers & senders)
  1. For an email to go from sender to receiver, the email data must be split into more manageable packets.
  2. Headers are added to the packets, containing data such as where it's from and where it's going to be sent.
  3. The packets are in the form of binaries and sent via radio waves to the router.
  4. The data is sent via electricity pulses (copper wires) or laser pulses (fiber optic wires) from the router to the ISP wires.
- Internet hubs: The ISP wires transmit the data to the internet hub, where it reads the headers and figure out the most efficient route.
- Internet backbone: 
  1. The data are transmitted as light waves to other network long-distance through a cable highway under the sea.
  2. Once the light wave data comes out to the other side, the process is reversed to be sent to the receiver.
